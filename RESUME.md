## Projects

### E = MC<sup>2</sup> UChicago Journal

A science journal made for the Professor David Mazziotti, this project is a React app made for modular article design for an upgrade to the website. The professor has taken the website now to continue to populate it with the older articles.

### Splack

A compiled markup language to make HTML websites with this new language. Before I stopped working on it, the language supported styling and display tags for information all ran on a compiled webserver.

### BadDB

A joke-made project to replace the tool firebase for custom projects in python since I was frustrated with the integration that the Python bindings for firebase were. It has a self hosted server and a client script with a relational database that is stored locally. In the future it will continue to have subscriptions, automated encryptions, and more scalable settings as right now it is simply scalable vertically.

### DoorCam

Smart homes are the future but currently homes lack security. In a project by a team we strived to solve this with facial recognition on doors, where we developed the facial recognition system and presented it in a pitch competetion in a hackathon.

### ClassCore

Learning is conducted online more than ever nowadays, and we still lack a proper collaborative community to post classes... introducing ClassCore, a place where people can publish books and articles and teachers can combine them all to make a learning environment for all.
