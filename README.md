# Hi! My name is Aditya Tiwari
hobbyist programmer and starry-eyed start up developer

### Resume: [RESUME.md](https://github.com/AdiTiwa/AdiTiwa/blob/main/RESUME.md) in the AdiTiwa repository.

My real passion lies in research and using the tech we make and trying to **support** and **help** people around me in my **community** and otherwise. I believe as developers our inherent purpose is to make the world we see more accessable to people who don't see the world the same way we do with meaningful content (AI, Data, etc.), UX design, and the communication necessary to convey this important information

## Current Fascination: The Alignment Problem
Essentially lying in the data being fed to Machine Learning Algorithms, the Alignment Problem lies in biases found in Artificial Intelligence (e.g. the NIST FRT racial injustice case and the google mishaps). Solutions now range from auditing databases to sytemically auditing databases (oh..) and are the focus of my learning as it is a massive pertaintent problem.

## Current Projest
IoT is BIG, and we need languages capabile to develop such intricate systems, but also beginner friendly... enter CSimple, the real passion project... check it out on my github!
